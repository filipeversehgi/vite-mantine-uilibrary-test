# Welcome to BuildHero Core Components!

Made with ❤️ by Scalio's Team

## How to use

You just need to make sure your project is allowed to fetch NPM packages from our private registry,
then, just go install with:

```bash
yarn add @scalio/buildhero-core-components
```

## Theme

This project offers a way of synching it's theme with **Figma UntitledUI Pro Variables**

1. Install Figma plugin **variables2json**
2. Export the variables from your Figma file into a file called `variables.json`
3. Upon installation, this plugin will look for an existing file in your project root and use it

> If no `variables.json` is found, this plugin will stick to it's default theme

# Showcase

Here you can find the default theme applied to a set of components, to check their adherence to UntitledUI configurations.

<Unstyled>
    <MantineProvider defaultColorScheme="light" theme={theme}>
        <HomePage />
    </MantineProvider>
</Unstyled>
